## How to contribute to Optional

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

Just open an issue to discuss your changes or directly open a PR with your changes.


## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)](developer-certificate-of-origin.txt). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution.
The DCO is a legally binding statement, please [read it carefully](developer-certificate-of-origin.txt).

If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

```
  Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.org>
```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`.
Now you can commit with `git ci` and the commit will be signed.
